Survival is the randomized gauntlet game mode. The objective is to clear as many floors as possible in a single Survival run.

In Survival mode, enemies drop tokens upon defeat. These tokens can be used to purchase supplies from vending machines, or to purchase upgrades from upgrade stations. These upgrade stations also sometimes offer the ability to "send home" tokens, sacrificing their usability in the current run in order to add them to the meta-inventory. Meta-inventory tokens can be used to purchase extra supplies that can be brought along in future Survival runs, or to purchase special cosmetic rewards.

Version Differences:
