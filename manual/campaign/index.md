Campaign is the story mode of Tensor 1. Currently two story campaigns are available:
- Campaign A: a 4-level demonstration story campaign
- Campaign B: a full 16-level story campaign

For business and legal reasons we cannot promise future content updates, but we can say that the underlying software architecture was designed to accomodate the addition of more than 2 campaigns.

### Version Differences:
- PC: contains campaigns A and B
- Web Demo: contains campaign A

### General Hints

- Confused where to go? Maybe there is a crawl space cover you missed.
- The force tool pulling effect goes through fences and barriers.
- Bullets go through fences and barriers.
