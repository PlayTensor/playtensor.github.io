# Quickstart

### Singleplayer Levels

Select "Extras" in the main menu, then select "Level Editor" in the Extras panel.

**Note**: If the "Extras" option does not appear in the main menu, you are playing on a version of the game that does not include Extras. The Mobile and Web Browser versions of the game currently do not support the Editor due to hardware and security limitations.

### Multiplayer Maps

Select "Versus" in the main menu, then select "Create Versus Maps" in the Versus panel.

**Note**: If the "Versus" option does not appear in the main menu, you are playing on a version of the game that does not include Versus mode. The Mobile and Web Browser versions of the game currently do not support multiplayer due to hardware and security limitations.
