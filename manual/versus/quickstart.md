# Quickstart

To play Versus mode, select "Versus" in the main menu.

**Note**: If the "Versus" option does not appear in the main menu, you are playing on a version of the game that does not include Versus mode. The Mobile and Web Browser versions of the game currently do not support multiplayer due to hardware and security limitations.

## Creating a Game

If you are connected to Steam, an option will appear in the bottom left allowing you to advertise your game to Steam's master server, allowing other players on Steam to join the game through Steam.

**WARNING** Advertising your game on Steam will make your IP address publicly available.

## Joining a Game

**WARNING** There is always a security risk in connecting with another computer. Do not join a game you do not recognize and trust.

### Joining over a Local Area Network (LAN)

Select the LAN Server Browser option to open a browser of all available games on the Local Area Network. This is the recommended method of joining a multiplayer game.

### Joining over the Internet via Steam

If you are connected to Steam, an option will appear at the bottom to open a server browser of all games currently advertising themselves on Steam.

### Joining over the Internet via IP Address and Port

Enter the IP Address and Port of the server host.
