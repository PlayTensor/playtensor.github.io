While trying to define the design goals for the overall setting and mood of *Tensor 1*, we kept coming back to one central idea: loneliness.

### Building a Setting on a Budget

*Tensor 1* had to be built with very limited technology, art, and sound budgets. (Here budget refers to things like limitations on development time and computer resources, not monetary budgets.) Non-player characters (NPCs) are very expensive in all three aspects, so to keep costs down, we decided to go against the modern conventional wisdom that players love friendly characters and focus NPC development efforts exclusively into building hostile monsters. This meant that the game experience would be based on the idea of a player completely alone in a hostile environment, and the world's aesthetic, setting, and story should reinforce that concept.

### Ambient Sound

The overwhelming majority of the *Tensor 1* soundtrack consists of ambient tracks seeking to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than provide an entertaining melody or rhythm. The two exceptions to this pattern are the elevator music and the radio music, but these exceptions are intended to heighten the overall atmosphere through contrast. Both the elevator music and radio music are intended to serve as simple relaxing melodies, but their presence draws attention to a general lack of comforting music throughout the majority of the game world.

### Setting

*Tensor 1* takes place in an underground facility. Choosing this as a setting offered a lot of advantages for staying within the project's limited technology and art budget. Most man-made architecture heavily uses squares and rectangles, which allowed the square tile based nature of the underlying game architecture to be more justified by the in-game setting. If the facility were built and managed by a particularly thrifty organization that liked to re-use materials, the costs of texture art and prop models could be kept relatively low and stay well within the project's overall art budget.

### Story

3D action games are **not** the best medium for story-telling. During some earlier interations of what would become *Tensor 1*, more ambitious stories were considered and pursued, but story ultimately had to be scaled back in order to fit within the constraints of a 3D action game. Ultimately, *Tensor 1* is a game, not a book.

However, some aspects of the more ambitious story ideas have left a shadow on *Tensor 1*, mostly in the form of the whiteboard drawings, abandoned personal computer workstations, and occasional wall defacements. In particular, some levels of the B campaign contain hidden whiteboard drawings that serve as a pseudo-storyboard for an abandoned storyline idea. So, in a way, the story did take place in the world of *Tensor 1*, it just so happens that it's not the player's story, at least while playing campaign A or B.

There won't be any promises of future story campaigns: doing something like promising a trilogy and then giving up after the second entry would be a nightmare scenario. But there is quite a large backlog of ideas for stories set in the world of *Tensor 1* that could be used if circumstances allow for them, and the game logic and data models used in *Tensor 1* were intentionally designed to accomodate multiple separate story campaigns, so most of the internal circumstances are actuall quite favorable. It will ultimately come down to how the external circumstances turn out.
