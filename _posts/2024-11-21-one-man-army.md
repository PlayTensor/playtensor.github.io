*Tensor 1* was developed by a one person team. Sort of.

Not to point fingers at any project in particular, but many of the "one person projects" out there that are famous for being "one person projects" did in fact have multiple contributors once you dig deep enough, often in the form of a forgotten artist or musician or programmer working on commision or temporary contract. And that's not even getting into things like testers or commentators who might have inspired so much from only a few chance words of feedback. And then there are all the resources and tools. Did you write your own game engine? Your level editor? Your graphics editor? Your digital audio workstation? Did you build your own computer? Did you mine your own cobalt?

> In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow

Collaboration is unavoidable, and in many ways is desirable. As much as some would like to believe otherwise, no one is actually *that* talented or interesting. Having multiple contributors means having multiple perspectives, which in turn means a richer overall experience. And even more importantly, no one has that much *time*. Without all the foundations to build on top of, nothing would ever get done.

### Testers

First and foremost, I would like to thank each and every tester who tried out the game and gave feedback, suggestions, criticisms, praises, and words of support. The testers touched on and therefore helped improve every aspect of the game, from the technology, to the art, to the music, to the writing, to the design.

### Technology

The game logic, the artificial intelligence of the monsters and enemies, the weapon behavior logic, the user interface, the multiplayer logic, the tile-based level editor, etc. were all coded and built in-house, but on top of the foundational tool sets and resources of the Godot Engine 3.x branch, OpenGL, the Bullet Physics Library, and more. And for it all to even to be able to run, think of all the software and hardware that make up your computing device, that is so often taken for granted. Think of everything that powers the Internet an the digital distribution through the Internet. Countless engineers both past and present gave it their all to make our modern digital world possible.

### Assets

Most of the art assets (both 2D and 3D) and sound assets (effects, soundscapes, and music) are modifications, customizations, remixes, or built on top of base templates so generously released into the public domain, under public domain equivalent licenses, or under no-attribution-required permissive licenses. Those who so generously give out their work make us all culturally richer for it. And of course, making these modifications, customizations, remixes, and so on would not have been possible without tools like Krita, Blender, Audacity, LMMS, and more.

The writing and broader aspects of the overall design are owed to the mass of culture that has passed before my eyes and through my ears over the years: all the books, comics, movies, television shows, online videos, and even other video games that I have had the good fortune to encounter.

### And the Rest

And of course, I could not have kept working on the project if not for the economy, culture, and society at large, which allowed me to sell my time and labor for money in the day job market, and then use that money to buy food and shelter to allow me to work nights and weekends. It wasn't easy, but somehow it worked long enough to reach this far, and with good fortune it can keep working a little while longer.
