Barring some unforseen complication, *Tensor 1* is expected to release for PC on Steam on November 19, 2024.

### Going Gold Then and Now

Can we take a moment to appreciate just how fast deployment has become in our modern age thanks to digital distribution? Back in the old days, software often had to be distributed physically via disks, because the networks of old were too slow and unreliable to send "large" amounts of data, where "large" could mean something like 1 MB. (For reference, at time of writing, the FCC currently defines broadband Internet connection as one that provides at least 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload).

A consequence of that was that software would have to "go gold" and "ship" weeks before release. A final version of the software would be declared the "gold master" copy from which other copies would be made, the gold master then physically "shipped" to a factory to make those copies, and those copies then physically "shipped" to retail stores. So developers would have to be "done" weeks before they got to see their work on store shelves. *Tensor 1* would have needed to have already gone gold today in order to make its release date.

Another consequence was that patching software was a slow and expensive processs that required making even more physical disks in a factory and sending them to retail stores, where they were often offered to existing customers for free despite the costs of manufacturing and distribution. Even then, developers would still have to just hope that customers would put in the effort to go get the disk to patch their software. For this reason, the final push to finish the gold master version of a software often meant grueling around the clock marathons of finding and fixing as many bugs as physically possible, because once the software was stamped on a physical disk and shipped to a customer, there was very little chance of ever fixing it.

Thanks to digital distribution, we can now work basically right up to the bell: we will be collecting feedback from the open Steam playtest and using it to improve the game in the final weeks right up to the official release. And, while we will still be doing the grueling around the clock marathon of finding and fixing as many bugs as possible until release, digital distribution means that we won't have to go through crippling depression if any happen to slip through. Fixes can continue to be released to customers even after launch.

And not just fixes either. In the old days, expansion packs often needed to be sold as retail products in order to cover the costs of manufacturing and distribution of disks. Thanks to digital distribution, if *Tensor 1* should ever happen to get a major content expansion update, it can be delivered digitally to existing customers for free.
