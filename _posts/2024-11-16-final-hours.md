### Slipping Away

*Tensor 1* was supposed to have gone gold by November 7th in preparation for its November 19th release date. It's now November 16th, and project lead Jack is still at his desk, his eyes darting back and forth between his computer screen and a small whiteboard beside the desk. On the whiteboard is a crude drawing of a calendar, its days marked off one by one. Despite the schedule slip, he insists *Tensor 1* will make its release date.

"It was actually a self-imposed slip," he admits. "A few days before the 7th, as I crunching away, I had an epiphany: it's not 1984 anymore. The game isn't going to have a physical release. It releases as soon as I press the button. I don't have to account for the time it takes to stamp discs and ship them to retail stores. I can just keep working until it's time to hit the button."

It is at times like these that Jack can joke that not having a team was a good thing. A team would not have appreciated having its workload suddenly extended by almost two weeks on the whims of one megalomaniacal lead, especially after months of working nearly 18 hours a day with no weekends off. And yes, he is aware of the insanity of calling himself a project lead when he has no team to lead: "I am a 'standard bearer without an army,' to borrow from the work of a much better writer," he says.

He is quick to add that he has no grudges against those who declined to join the team: "I completely understand. I would have said 'no' too. This was a project being led by a nobody with no experience, no skills, and most importantly, no money. Anyone willing to work on a project like that would have to be completely insane."

This time he does seem unaware of his own implied insanity.

### Mad Jack

It's a cliche at this point, but like so many others before him, 'Mad Jack,' as some called him in grade school, claims that he never imagined himself trying to make games.

"Childhood fantasies don't count," he quickly explains. "Little kids imagine doing any and every thing they hear of at some point. I'm sure I played a game as a kid and immediately thought about making my own, but unlike the real game developers, I never got to the point of actually trying to do something about it, not even picking up a pencil and doodling something on a piece of paper."

As if to emphasize this point, Jack mentions that he was already over 30 when he finally learned to code: "Learning new things as an old man is not easy, but it's possible to an extent. The main thing, I think, is to just get over the mental block of starting. Just dive in and try to get something working. Open the editor. Get a program to print something. Add or remove some pixels. Move some vertices around. Of course, I don't recommend doing that if you want to become a serious professional, I'm just saying it's what I did."

It was that same "dive in" attitude that supposedly got him into making a game: "At the time I thought it might be fun to try to make one, so I opened an editor and started messing around. I especially do not recommend that if you're trying to be a serious developer."

### Laying Foundations

"The beginning is the most fun, because you can have all these crazy ideas, and you don't know yet that they're way beyond your abilities." Probably for this reason, Jack is hesitant to talk about the earliest prototypes or ideas of what would become *Tensor 1.* "I can admit to being an idiot," he says, "but I don't like actually providing the proof."

What Jack will admit is that the ideas of what would eventually become *Tensor 1* began to solidify in June of 2022. "By that point I had been sufficiently humbled to set more realistic goals," recalls Jack. "And the idea that came to mind was something like Wolfenstein 3D (1992). It could have a first person perspective and feel like a 3D action game, but still be simple to work on because the world would be built by a 2D square grid editor. I even imagined it would release on mobile, since the controls could be simple enough to not have to worry about looking up or down."

It was so simple to set up, that a working prototype of the 3D world and first person character controller was completed within a month, and a prototype of the 2D grid editor in the next month. Once these foundations had been laid down, Jack got to work experimenting with objects to populate the world: guns, items, and monsters. He also began sharing playable prototypes in order to collect feedback, even in those early stages.

"One thing I sort of realized early on, is that being a nobody does have some advantages," says Jack. "If you're a developer with an established reputation and audience, you can't afford to show that much early on, because you can damage your reputation that way. The thing about games, probably all creative endeavors really, is that they're almost always terrible until you've poured at least a few hundred or thousand hours of work into making them not terrible. People are going to play through your early prototypes, have an absolutely miserable time, think you're a total incompetent, and swear off ever buying anything you ever make. But if you're a nobody, people won't really care that much that you're incompetent. Best of all, they won't even bother to remember you, so you can just show up again in two months with a slightly better but still terrible prototype, and no one will even notice."

He also admits that the first few public showings were part of an ultimately futile effort to recruit. "Most creators understand that stuff is terrible until it isn't, so I was hoping that some creators might still see some small potential and want to contribute," says Jack. "At the time I imagined the project would be just for fun and experience, released for free, and that others might want to jump in for fun and experience too. I actually managed to get a few people interested enough to talk and bounce ideas around, but every one of them pretty quickly decided to leave and focus on their own projects. Which I understand completely. At the time, there was no coherent vision on how to make the project not terrible, so it made way more sense for them to work on their own stuff instead of wasting their time and effort on something that looked like it was just running in circles without direction."

### Unwitting Contributors

Being unable to build a team, however, meant that Jack would have to do almost everything himself. Almost.

"I'm an old guy who can remember the pre-Internet days, which is kind of nice, because it helps me appreciate what the Internet has allowed," says Jack. "There are so many free assets and resources if you care to search for them. There are so many incredibly talented and incredibly generous artists, animators, musicians, programmers, engineers, and so on just offering stuff out there for free and under permissive licenses. I like to think of them all as unwitting contributors to the project. I couldn't convince anyone to contribute willingly, but I probably have dozens of unknowing contributors."

Of course, Jack is not the only one who has discovered the ease of finding and using pre-made assets, which has led some critics to lament the spread of "asset flips," cheap low-quality games that can be mass-produced with pre-made assets. When asked if he is concerned that his game might be suffer accusations of asset flipping, Jack hesitates. "I don't think the problem is using pre-made assets," he says after a while. "I think it's a question of whether the developer put in the effort to make the assets work together to craft a coherent experience. If a game is well-crafted, players won't notice that the assets were sourced from a third party. If it isn't, the assets can feel out of place and poorly done even if they were all bespoke assets made specificially for the game."

He is also quick to add that he tried to follow a personal rule in his asset use. "I try to touch and modify assets whenever I can," says Jack. "The goal is to make everything fit together into a coherent whole, so trying to modify every asset forces me to think carefully about how the asset fits into the game before actually putting it in, and make appropriate changes if necessary."

Some of these changes took the form of optimizations. "I don't want to point any fingers or sound ungrateful to all the 3D model creators who so generously release their work for free under permissive licenses, but I was amazed at how many triangles were in some of the models tagged as 'low poly.' A fair bit of time had to go into reducing polygon count to fit within the game's polygon budget."

Another justification for building on top of pre-made assets, at least according to Jack, is that it meant he could spend more time and energy on other parts of the game. "There are some things that can't really be outsourced to unwitting contributors very well," he says. "I can kitbash pre-existing 3D models into something that looks like a rifle, but it's a lot harder for me to cobble together a level editor or a monster AI out of someon else's code."

By late 2022, Jack had come to the suspect that the tile-based level editor and monster AI might become the game's core features. To that end, he began working on a built-in editor that players could access within the game to create and play their own levels, which required crash courses in data encoding and user interface design. Building a monster AI flexible enough to manage almost any possible player created map meant extensive study of game AI techniques and periods of wild experimentation, with the monster AI being thrown out and restarted multiple times. What had originally supposed to have been a simple Wolfenstein 3D clone "tech demo" to be released in 2022 was scope creeping into continued development in 2023.

### Trial by Fire

"My feelings on the game have always been like a sine wave," says Jack. "I'd get excited about the state of the project, get overconfident, make a playable demo and share it, and then get rather forcefully brought back down to reality. Then I'd pick up the pieces at the bottom, incorporate the feedback into building more features and refining the design, get excited, and start the whole process over again."

"Anonymous play testers can be brutal in their feedback sometimes," continues Jack. "But that's a good thing. It can be painful to read, and there might sometimes be a few small parts that won't be all that helpful (like the rare personal attack), but you have to take the bad with the good. It hurts being told 'all your work is garbage and by extension you are garbage,' but you have to remember that the goal isn't to feel good, it's to make an amazing product. Study their feedback, figure out what made them mad, and improve the product to address the problem."

"The overwhelming majority of feedback is very civil anyways," he quickly adds. "I'd say the comments that get mad enough to try to make it personal are probably one out of a hundred, maybe even fewer. It's just that the angriest comments sometimes get stuck in your head."

A common point of the earliest criticisms were the game's flat design. "Early versions of the game were so based on the 2D mindset that the player couldn't look up or down or jump. Play testers hated that and demanded a freer mouse look and jump. At first I tried giving a really small, almost entirely cosmetic jump, but that actually made things worse, because testers would constantly try to jump on something that looked like they could jump on and get frustrated when they failed. I got one particularly traumatizing tirade from a tester for that. It was a learning experience for sure."

Why were there problems over something as simple as a jump? "Very, very poor planning," admits Jack. "I'd built the early versions of the monster AI and a whole lot of the early level architecture only thinking about the player's 2D position. Adding things like jumping and crouching meant having to redo a lot of early work to suddenly account for an entire extra dimensions. Monsters would need to know if the player was too high or low to hit. Relative heights of objects would need to be designed around each other to make sure the player could never trap themselves somehow by jumping from one thing to another. But in the end, I had to just take my punishment for my poor planning and design, and redo a lot of the game. It's what the game needed. While the levels are still tile based and overall still very flat, testers don't notice or complain about the flatness nearly as much as they used to."

The cycle of excitement, testing, and disillusionment grew into a cycle of scope creep and schedule slips. Plans for release in Q1 2023 slipped to Q2, then to Q3, then to Q4. Worst of all, against the advice of numerous testers and commentators, Jack decided to turn the game into a retail product for sale.

"During one particularly bad excitement build-up cycle, I decided to make the game a retail product," says Jack. "I thought that if I released it as a retail product, I could prove to myself that I could make something good and exciting enough that people would willingly pay money to have it. That 'shut up and take my money' meme is the dream of every creator. Some testers immediately tried to talk me out of it by pointing out that 'proving yourself' is always a terrible motivation to do anything, that there was no market for this kind of game and hadn't been for 30 years. Who would anyone buy a tile based shooter after Doom made them obsolete in 1993? Unfortunately, that just made me want to do it even more. Their warnings made it all feel like a challenge to be overcome."

To meet this new ambitious target, another year of development time was added to the schedule, plus one more big scope creep push.

### The Gen-X Touch

In addition to refining the technology and design through regular play testing, much of 2023 and then 2024 was spent on defining a unified theme for the game's setting, art direction, and sound direction.

"A lot of it just fell naturally out of the constraints of the game being such a low-budget project," Jack claims. (Here budget refers to limits on development time and computing resources, not money). "For example, friendly NPCs in a 3D world can be incredibly expensive in terms of technology, art, animation, and sound requirements. I obviously didn't have the budget for that, so the game very naturally became about loneliness. It's all about one poor player completely lost and alone in a strange hostile world. Then that led naturally into the sound and music direction: the soundtrack direction would be about setting an ambient atmosphere of isolation."s

Meanwhile, the science-engineering facility setting came from the square tile structure of the game. "Obviously, if you make a tile based game, the world is going to be very rectangular," says Jack. "Thankfully, most man-made architecture is very rectangular, so you can justify a rectangular world as a man-made building. It also helped keep the texture and material budget low, because if the facility were built by a particularly thrifty organization, you'd naturally expect them to re-use a lot of building materials."

According to Jack, these directions eventually led to what he likes to call a "Gen-X touch" to the game.

"Before I get tons of hate for this, I will say that I'm sure plenty of people came up with the idea before me," says Jack. "The phrase 'boomer shooter' has been around for a decade by now, and after that phrase took off, people inevitably started making 'Greatest Generation shooter' jokes to refer to Wolfenstein 3D's setting as a World War II game. So defining a 'Gen-X shooter' and 'Millenial' shooter is such a natural next step that loads of people must have been doing it for a while. I'm only saying that I independently came up with my own version. You know, like that 1994 medical paper that rediscovered the trapezoidal rule of integration."

In Jack's version, the Boomer shooter is defined by the examples of mid 1990s shooters like Doom (1993) and Quake (1996), the Gen-X shooter as the next wave of late 1990s to early 2000s shooters such as Quake II (1997) and Sin (1998) and Half-Life (1998), and the Millenial shooter by the next wave of mid 2000s shooters such as Half-Life 2 (2004) and Doom 3 (2004). "The running themes through the Gen-X shooters, at least in my eyes, were more narrative, more world-building, and more world interactivity," says Jack. "Obviously these things were already present in the Boomer shooters, but the Gen-X shooters added another level to it."

"Things got a bit easier after coming up with these definitions," continues Jack. "All of a sudden there was this set of guiding principles for coming up with new ideas of what to add to the game. What will make the world more interactive? What will make the world feel like it has stories baked into its hallways? What will make the world feel more alive?"

In early 2024, increased interactivity meant the addition of a pull-push force tool, letting players grab and throw physics objects in the game world. The classic red and blue key pick-ups often seen in Doomlike games were replaced with physical batteries to be picked up and placed in electronic locks, but which could also be used as an electrical weapon when thrown against monsters. By the end of Spring, Jack was reasonably satisfied with the world interactivity, but quickly realizing he had made a mistake in schedule planning once again.

### Push vs Pull

"In 2023, I got a little too caught up in the mechanics and systems and neglected content creation and level design," says Jack. "I had made a bunch of toys and tools, but not an actual game. And I would need to learn level design very quickly if I were going to make a game by 2024."

Jack credits the online publications of [Ian Bryce Jones, PhD,](https://intermittentmechanism.blog/) as serving as a crash course for level design and game design, and for teaching him Push vs Pull design. As explained in one of Jones's online lectures, the concept descends from the idea of push vs pull learning in education theory. Push learning is guided by the teacher: the teacher constructs a curriculum and "pushes" it onto the student in content and assignments. Pull learning is guided by the student: the student decides what content "pulls" them in and follows their own interests and passions. Extending into video games, sometimes the player is pushed to do certain things, given assignments, told to follow command prompts or objective markers or navigation arrows. Other times, the player may be pulled into the game, lured in by a need or desire for in-game supplies or items, or even by simple curiosity.

"It really helps guide the level design because it sets a simple goal: find the right balance of push and pull," explains Jack. "Too much pushing and not enough pulling will lead to a player feeling like they're just going down a checklist of assigned tasks rather than playing in and exploring a world. Too much pulling and not enough pushing will lead to a player wandering around lost and confused with no idea what they're supposed to do. I would watch playtesters, see where they would get stuck or bored, and try to figure out ways to push or pull them in certain directions."

### The Summer Crunch

Having committed to shipping before the end of 2024, Jack realized he would need to make a lot of personal sacrifices to make the date. All other personal projects were quietly shelved or shut down entirely. Everything he did would have to be only one of three things: (1) working at his day job, (2) personal maintainance chores like eating and sleeping, and (3) finishing the game. Everything else would have to go.

"I did maybe cheat a little by sometimes stretching the definition of what could count as working on the game," admits Jack. "I'd do things like play a video game or watch a movie or read a book or chat with a friend under the excuse that it was 'research' or 'getting inspiration.' But I did try to keep little cheats like that to a minimum because while I could sometimes lie to myself, I could never lie to to the clock."

By mid-summer, the crunch began to take a surprising physical toll. "I think around late July or so, I started having occasional chest pains," says Jack. "The messed up thing is that for a while I was actually sort of proud of that. Like, it was proof that I was working hard, that I was really sacrificing to make the game better. I'd joke about the chest pains with friends, almost brag about it."

It stopped being so funny when the pain became more frequent and spread from his chest to left arm. "There was a day in September where the pain was so bad that I was actually seriously afraid that I might just drop dead. I knew I had to pull back then. You can't ship if you're dead."

### The Final Cuts

In a desperate attempt to relieve some of the mounting pressure, Jack made one last cut to his life: his day job. Since 2020, Jack had supported himself as a temp worker, working a series of short term contracts lasting between 6 and 12 months, finding a new one right before the previous ended. But in the fall of 2024, he let a contract expire without having another one ready.

"I had a 12 month contract that was ending," says Jack. "The smart thing would have been to have a new job lined up for right after the contract ended. I usually did that, but I didn't this time. I was just so exhausted during the summer crunch that I didn't want to both do my day job, work on my game, and search for a new job, all at the same time. So I just ignored the problem and ended up unemployed once the contract ended. Of course, what I should have done next was search for a new job while working on the game, but I was just so tired and angry that I didn't. I just kept working on the game instead. In retrospect, that was so stupid. I don't recommend it, obviously, I'm just saying that it's what I did. Seriously, don't do what I did."

An unexpected side effect was that the 2024 release commitment could not slip again. "If you have a large employment gap in your resume, you can almost never find another job ever again," explains Jack. "Every recruiter or hiring manager who sees the gap will immediately decide that you're someone no one else wants to hire and obviously not want to hire you either. If I didn't find another job really soon, I'd never get another on. But I just couldn't bring myself to seriously job search until the game was done, because I was still too tired and angry. So finishing the game became a literal do or die. If I didn't finish soon enough, I'd never get another job and, well, go homeless and starve."

In order to complete the game, Jack went through a hard self-critical review of the game to figure out what needed to be removed. He scrawled two classic adages onto his whiteboard: "Real Artists Ship" and "Cutting is Shipping." The latter adage is based on the idea that it is almost always better to have fewer features done well than to have a lot of features done poorly. In order to finish and deliver a good product, unfinished features should be removed (cut) in order to redirect time and energy into finishing what remains. The novel *Dune* (1965) elegantly expresses the idea in one of its most famous quotes:

> Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife — chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: “Now, it’s complete because it’s ended here.

When asked where the biggest cuts went, Jack is quick to answer. "The story," he says immediately. "When I started out, I had some really stupidly ambitious ideas of wanting to write deep emotional stories that would make players laugh and cry. But with the release date coming so soon, I had to take a hard look at what was possible within the art, animation, and time budget, and figure out how to cut back. But honestly, I think that's okay. As the old saying goes, 'we're making a game, not writing a book.'"

Some parts of these more ambitious story ideas still left a shadow on the game, mostly in the form of in-game whiteboard drawings, abandoned personal computer workstations, and occasional wall defacements. "In the B campaign, there are some hidden whiteboard drawings," says Jack. "Those drawings are from storyboards of abandoned storyline ideas. So I like to think that, in a way, some of the cut stories actually did take place in the world of *Tensor 1*, it just so happens that it's not the player's story, at least while playing campaign B."

"I also have a fun idea for salvaging another abandoned story idea using the game's support website," he adds with a mischievous smile. He declines to elaborate further: "It's a surprise."

### One Final Scare

Jack insists on sharing one more anecdote from nearly the end of development: "On November 1, the computer I was developing on died. Completely. I spent the entire day desperately recovering files onto another computer. So, you know, always keep backups."

### The Power of Delusion

When asked if he feels optimistic about *Tensor 1*, Jack laughs: "If I weren't optimistic, I wouldn't be releasing, would I? A pessimist would have given up a long time ago."

But when pressed, Jack grudgingly admits that the future is not bright. "I have the analytics. I have the feedback from play testers. I can be optimistic enough to push ahead no matter what the data says, but not to ignore the data completely."

Despite his bad situation, Jack manages to keep a Xen-like calm. "I won't deny it: failure sucks. You don't want to do a bad job. You don't want to fail, especially after some pretty big personal sacrifices. But sometimes your best just isn't good enough. You kind of have to learn to just live with that. But hey, there's always the next game, right?"

Jack is quick to add that he doesn't believe in "launch and leave" and wants to continue to support the game after launch, and not only out of fear of modern reviewers who expect and demand continued support for all games, even self-contained single player experiences that sold fewer than 10 copies. "Obviously for the first few weeks I'll need to be on call for any possible bugs that might have somehow slipped through these final crunch weeks of testing," says Jack. "Beyond that, I have ideas for future updates I'd like to ship one day. Better support for user created content would obviously be at the top of the list. I always want to make it easier and easier for players to build their own maps and share them with friends. I think I'd also like to add another story campaign someday, seeing as I specifically designed the architecture of *Tensor 1* to support multiple campaigns. When working on the story, I originally imagined *Tensor 1* as an anthology series of interconnected short stories."

When can we expect those hypothetical updates? "Probably not for a while. Right now I'm just so exhausted that I can't even imagine myself actually doing any of that. But who knows? If I delude myself hard enough, maybe something can happen after I've rested up a little. And found a day job."

Looking back at the whiteboard and its crude calendar, there's a small note written on the day marked as November 20th: "Start job search."

"I've been trying to pretend that note isn't there for far too long," says Jack. "Deluding myself is a bad habit. But I think, to a certain degree, you have to be a little delusional to do something creative. If I hadn't lied to myself so much while working on *Tensor 1*, I wouldn't have finished it! *Tensor 1* only happened through the power of delusion."

Jack claims that the fact that *Tensor 1* is titled *Tensor 1* and not just *Tensor* was not due to delusion. "It was the opposite," he swears. "As hard as I tried, I couldn't lie to myself enough to really believe a *Tensor 2* would be possible. But there was something I had always wanted to do, and that was to make something with a science-math theme that then had a sequel with a 2 in the title, so that I could make a logo that used the 2 look like an exponent. You know, something like T squared. And then I realized, hey, there's really nothing stopping me from just calling something 1 from the beginning and making a logo with a 1 as the exponent. I don't need to wait for a 2!"

But maybe he's just deluding himself.
