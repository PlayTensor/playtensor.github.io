# Communication Channel Identities

The **only** official media associated with this product are this website and the product's [store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3299900) on Steam. The **only** way to communicate with the development team is through Steam or the team's official contact [email](mailto:contact.magentagrid@gmail.com). Currently **no one** on the development team has accounts on or posts on twitter, facebook, discord, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, 4channel, whatsapp, etc. and therefore no communication will ever take place through these channels (We will update the post **if** we end up adding communication channels on any other platforms). Any appearance otherwise is, at best, a case of mistaken identity or, at worst, an impersonation. Former members of the development team, **if any**, do not speak for the current development team.

# Not an Indie

*Tensor* is not an indie game. There was a long time ago when "indie" was short for "independent," but the term has since evolved to describe a certain style or genre. *Tensor* is not in the indie genre.
