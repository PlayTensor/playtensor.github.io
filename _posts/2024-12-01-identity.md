The **only** official media associated with this product are this website and the product's [store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3299900) on Steam. The **only** way to communicate with the development team is through Steam, or the team's official development email. **No one** on the development team has accounts on twitter, facebook, discord, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, 4channel, whatsapp, etc. and therefore no communication will ever take place through these channels. Any appearance otherwise is, at best, a case of mistaken identity or, at worst, an impersonation.
