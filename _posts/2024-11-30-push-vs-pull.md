In education theory, there is a concept of push vs pull learning. Push learning is guided by the teacher: the teacher constructs a curriculum and "pushes" it onto the student in content and assignments. Pull learning is guided by the student: the student decides what content "pulls" them in and follows their own interests and passions.

Obviously, this concept easily extends beyond education into other fields. For instance, push vs pull thinking can be useful in game design. In video games, sometimes the player is pushed to do certain things, given assignments, told to follow command prompts or objective markers or navigation arrows. Other times, the player may be pulled into the game, lured in by a need or desire for in-game supplies or items, or even by simple curiosity.

In marketing, a business can use push strategies, like paying for advertisements, or a business can use pull strategies, like setting up an online presence with content that it hopes will attract potential customers.

Good education, good game design, etc., will use both push and pull strategies. The difficulty is in finding the right balance for each situation. In game design, too much pushing can make a player feel like they are just going down a checklist of assigned tasks rather than having fun. Too much pulling, however, can leave players wandering around a game world, lost and confused as to what they are supposed to do.

That said, as a student, a game player, and as a consumer, I do think there has been a general overall tendency to err on the side of too much pushing. For that reason, I have tended to err on the side of pulling. If that means you have gotten stuck on a certain level in the *Tensor 1* story campaign, hopefully [Campaign section]({% link manual/campaign/index.md %}) in the online manual can provide some help.
