When we launched *Tensor*, we expected it would be the beginning of a long journey, that it would lay the foundation for years to come. Our plan was to immediately dive into our normal strategy of shipping a series of updates driven by the dialogue community members were having with each other and with us.

Obviously, things didn't turn out how we hoped. *Tensor* represents the largest discrepancy between our expectations for how one of our games would be received and the actual outcome. But we don't think that players misunderstand the game, or that they're playing it wrong. *Tensor* now represents an opportunity for us to improve our craft and use that knowledge to build better games.

Since launch, we've been looking carefully at how players interact with the game as well as gathering feedback. It has become clear that there are deep-rooted issues with the game and that our original update strategy of releasing new story campaigns, maps, game modes, weapons, and editor tiles would be insufficient to address them. Instead, we believe the correct course of action is to take larger steps, to re-examine the decisions we've made along the way regarding game design, the experience of playing, and more.

So what does this mean?

Moving forward, we'll be heads-down focusing on addressing these larger issues. While we expect this process of experimentation and development to take a significant amount of time, weâ€™re excited to tackle this challenge and will get back to you as soon as we are ready.
