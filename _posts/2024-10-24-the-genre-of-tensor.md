*Tensor 1* is a hybrid of the greatest generation shooter, silent generation shooter, and generation X shooter sub-genres. What does that mean?

### Generations of Shooters

The term "boomer shooter" developed as slang to define a sub-genre within the genre of first person shooters that were similar to a certain group of shooters that were popular in the 1990s. The core examples of these would be Doom (1993) and Quake (1996). The choice of "boomer" probably started as a joke, as the creators and players of these games were not of the "baby boomer" generation. At the time the term was coined, people of the baby boomer generation were among the older generations, so it "boomer" developed into slang to mean "old" in general. It probably also helped that "boom" could be interpreted to apply to the heavy-sounding shotguns and rocket launchers that often appeared in the shooter games of the 1990s.

We can take advantage of the "baby boomer" reference however, and extend it into other generations in order to define more sub-genres within the first person shooter genre. These generations/sub-genres, with core examples, would be:

| Generation          | Core Examples                                                | Notes                     |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| Greatest            | Wolfenstein 3D (1992)                                        | Tile-based simplicity     |
| Silent              | Blake Stone (1993)                                           | Increased complexity      |
| Baby Boomer         | Doom (1993), Doom II (1994), Quake (1996)                    | Increased 3D technology   |
| Generation X        | Quake II (1997), Unreal (1998), Sin (1998), Half-Life (1998) | Increased world building  |
| Millenial           | Half-Life 2 (2004), Doom 3 (2004), Quake 4 (2005)            | Spectacle storytelling    |

### The Greatest Generation/Silent Generation/Generation X hybrid

*Tensor 1* seeks to combine the tile-based simplicity of Greatest and Silent Generation shooters with the world-building and narrative of Generation X shooters.

### Appendix: Defining Genres and Categories

When trying to define a genre or category, two popular approaches include:
1. Defining by Necessary & Sufficient Conditions
    a. Necessary: Something doesn't belong to a category if it doesn't meet each of these conditions.
    b. Sufficient: Something does belong to a category if it does meet all of these conditions.
2. Defining by Core vs Peripheral Examples

Defining categories by necessary and sufficient conditions is great for some things, such as logic or mathematics. Think of the categorization of numbers as prime or composite. However, when moving into fuzzier concepts, it can run into potential problems, such as in the famous (and probably apocryphal) anecdote:

> The philosopher Plato defined man as a "featherless biped." Upon learning of this, the philosopher Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it to Plato's Academy, declaring: "I have brought you Plato's man."

The alternative approach of Core and Peripheral doesn't need to worry about arguing over conditions. Instead it focuses on examples. Core examples are considered strong defining examples of the category, and peripheral examples help define the fuzzy borders of the category.

Genres in particular can be a very fuzzy and trick category to define as the definitions will constantly change as culture constantly evolves, with new genre definitions appear, growing, contracting, and disappearing. It can be a lot simpler to just point to Core and Peripheral examples of a genre than try to endlessly define and argue over conditions.
