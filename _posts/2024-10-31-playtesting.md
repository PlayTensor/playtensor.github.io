The Steam version of *Tensor 1* now supports Steam Playtesting. Players can request access to an in-development version of the game to help test and refine the game.

### No More Early Access

Early Access was previously considered for *Tensor 1*, to the point that a blurb was written for Steam's *Why Early Access?* description:

> *Why Early Access?*
>
> It's hard to test network feature with no friends.

The official *Tensor 1 Playtest* solves this problem. Players can now try out *Tensor 1*'s more experimental features and ensure they are working properly without having to risk their own money.

Requesting to join the Steam playtest is simple: go to the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3299900) for *Tensor 1* and click "Request Access" in the "Join the Tensor 1 Playtest" section. If you are especially interested and want to gain priority on the waitlist, you can contact us directly to request a playtest access key.

The playtest will end with the launch of the game in mid-November 2024.

### Web Demo

Also, the official demo has released. The entire 4-level "Campaign A" of Tensor 1 is available for **FREE** in the [Web Browser demonstration version](https://playtensor.itch.io).

Will not work on all Web Browsers. WebGL 1.0 support required. May have visual and audio glitches on some Web Browsers. This is sadly unavoidable (Web Browsers were not designed for games like these).
