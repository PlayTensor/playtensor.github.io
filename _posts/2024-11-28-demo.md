## Steam Demo

A native build version of the *Tensor 1* free demo is now available on Steam. [Get it now.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3299900)

The demo is a standalone version of the 4-level "Campaign A."

The full version contains the same content as the demo, plus the 16-level "Campaign B" (20 levels in total!), the score attack arcade style Survival mode, the multiplayer Versus mode, and a built-in level editor, for only $9.99 (less than $0.50 a level!)

## Possible Steam Playtest Reopening

The Steam playtest may re-open to begin testing a new 8-level story campaign "Campaign C."

Due to the vagaries of game development, we cannot guarantee that "Campaign C" will be released, nor that it will even reach the playtesting stage. Do **not** purchase the game with the expectation of a full "Campaign C" release.

Previous playtesters should automatically have access to the playtest **if** it re-opens. New playtesters may reach out by [email](mailto:contact.magentagrid@gmail.com) to request a playtest key.
