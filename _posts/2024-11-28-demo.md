## Steam Demo

A native build version of the *Tensor* free demo is now available on Steam. [Get it now.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3299900)

The demo is a standalone version of the 4-level "Campaign A."

The full version contains the same content as the demo, plus the 16-level "Campaign B" (20 levels in total!), the score attack arcade style Survival mode, the multiplayer Versus mode, and a built-in level editor, for only $9.99 (less than $0.50 a level!)
