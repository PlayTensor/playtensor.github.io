## Steam Demo

A native build version of the *Tensor 1* free demo is now available on Steam. [Get it now.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3299900)

The demo contains the 4-level "Campaign A."

The full version contains the same content as the demo, plus an additional 16-level "Campaign B", the score attack arcade style Survival mode, the multiplayer Versus mode, and a built-in level editor, for only $9.99.

## Possible Steam Playtest Reopening

The Steam playtest may re-open to begin testing a new 8-level story campaign under the placeholder title called "Campaign C."

Due to the vagaries of game development, we cannot guarantee that "Campaign C" will be released, nor that it will even reach the playtesting stage. Do **not** purchase the game with the expectation of a full "Campaign C" release.

Previous playtesters should automatically have access to the playtest if it re-opens. New playtesters may reach out by [email](mailto:contact.magentagrid@gmail.com) to request a playtest key.
