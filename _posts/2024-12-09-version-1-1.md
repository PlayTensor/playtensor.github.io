## Backward Compatability Breaking Changes
*Tensor* uses a four number semantic versioning system epoch.major.minor.patch, where major changes can potentially introduce unintended backward compatability breaking changes. The 1.1.0.0 update includes potential backward compatability breaking changes for Campaign and Survival mode save data due to changing file and directory structures.
