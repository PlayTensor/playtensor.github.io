## Privacy

This site uses GitHub for hosting. GitHub's privacy policies are available at:
- https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement
- https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection

On top of GitHub's spying, this site uses very basic Google Analytics. Google's policies are available at:
- https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites

I promise I'm not interested in spying on you specifically, I only want to see which parts of the website, particularly which parts of the Online Manual, are providing the most value, and which parts might need improvements.

Any questions can be sent to contact.magentagrid@gmail.com
